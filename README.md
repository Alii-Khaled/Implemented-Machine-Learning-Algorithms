# Implemented-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
Here I have implemented some machine learning algorithms completely by myself to get to deepen my understand to concepts behind them and to improve myself in Python.

Such as:-

1- Linear, Polynomial & Multiple Regressions

2- Lasso Regression

3- Ridge Regression

4- K-Nearest Neighbour

5- Linear Classifier (Logistic Regression)

6- Basic Decision Tree
